Step 12
You can turn any text into a link, such as the text inside of a p element.

<p>I think <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a> is great.</p>
In the text of your p element, turn the words cat photos into a link by adding opening and closing anchor (a) tags around these words. Then set the href attribute to https://freecatphotoapp.com

code starts on line 9 & my question is what am i doing wrong i did exaclty what the steps say do, i dont see any other way i could format it 

<html>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
      <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
      <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
  <p><a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a> See more cat photos in our gallery. </p>
      <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">link to cat pictures</a>
